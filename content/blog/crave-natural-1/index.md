<h3>The Problem</h3>

Our founder, Lin, was growing increasingly frustrated with her office-supplied breakfast and snack options while she was working at consulting firm BCG. When she arrived at her office in the morning, she only had two hot cereal options: a “healthy” flavorless variety with no nutritional value to speak of besides oats, and a delicious variety loaded with sugar and additives.

After talking to friends and colleagues, she discovered a larger problem: people today are seeking out increasingly personalized diets, but they often run into issues. There are so many diet trends and buzz words out there—low-carb, keto, non-GMO, gluten-free, etc.—that it’s hard to know what to eat in order to achieve your desired health outcomes. Maintaining a purpose-driven diet simply takes too much time and effort for the overworked professional.

<h3>The Solution</h3>

Thus, Crave Natural was born as a purposeful eating company that helps people thrive by changing the way they eat. After over 300 customer interviews and market research, we set out to build two complementary products that would fill the gap in the market.

First is a curated menu of low-sugar, high-protein, high-nutrient functional snack products, headlined by Crave Natural’s signature oatmeal. While our goal is to eventually provide a unique menu tailored to the specific needs of every customer, we are initially rolling out 4 pre-selected collections.

The second is a mobile application that will complement our functional food boxes. Through conversations with customers, we observed that the problem they face is not simply a lack of suitable food products on the market. Rather, these professionals want to buy a bundle of groceries tailored to their needs without having to walk into a store and painstakingly pick out the right products after a long day of work. They also want to set and measure progress against wellness goals that don’t simply revolve around weight loss targets. Thus, the app we needed to build would combine e-commerce, nutrition tracking and data reporting.

Since this is the part of the business that I lead, I’ll dive into more thoughts about the strategy and design of our mobile app.

<h3>The App</h3>

There are a lot of nutrition trackers out there; easily a dozen. What makes ours different is that it treats weight loss as only one of several target outcomes that a user can choose to pursue from a list that includes sleep, daily hours of focus, relaxation and more.

This decision was heavily influenced by conversations with customers. Something we heard over and over is that they are aware that while diet isn’t deterministic of health, it does heavily influence how one feels and performs. The customers we interviewed just didn’t have a way to quantify and track that relationship. We knew that whatever we built would have to accommodate these use cases as robustly as other apps do weight loss tracking.

Approaching the problem this way also presented unique challenges. For one, I’m not a trained nutritionist. While I might feel confident enough to build a calorie counting app myself, I knew that in order to do this right, we would need to incorporate expert insights into our diet tracking tools. We brought in an experienced nutritionist to join our product team that includes a mobile developer, a designer and me. Our nutrition expert provides key insights about evolving trends in nutritional science and a nuanced understanding of gaps in the market.

Additionally, each tracker needs to be simple and lightweight enough to prototype and deliver within a span of weeks, not months. Despite our desire to be everything to everyone, our team is entirely made of students working 20-30 hours a week, so we have to make tradeoffs both in process and product.

Finally, the Crave app gives users the ability to learn about Crave Natural menu options and purchase a subscription. Because the app was conceived of as a way to add extra value to a Crave Natural subscription, this feature is a must-have. The design challenge we faced here was making the in-app purchase experience feel identical to that on our website, Amazon page and other channels.

<h3>Where are we today?</h3>

As of this week, we have a prototype! Over the coming weeks, we will begin to user test our product and continue development. App launch will ideally coincide with release of our hot cereal recipes and functional snack boxes. Beginning in March, Crave Natural will hopefully participate in the University of Chicago New Venture Challenge (NVC). Wish us luck!
