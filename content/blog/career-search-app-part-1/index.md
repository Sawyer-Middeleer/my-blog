As a public policy student and someone who is generally interested in how society adapts to new technology, I am interested in what a lot of people call “the future of work,” particularly as it relates to career training and matching for populations that are currently underserved by our educational systems. Recently, I dove into research on occupational task automation. I noticed that along with predictions about whether and when jobs will be automated by algorithms was substantial handwringing about the anxiety that career destabilization was causing for workers.

I became curious about whether career search platforms offer anything practical to allay these anxieties. Do they identify skill training opportunities to workers in high-automation-risk roles? Can they recommend new jobs that are more likely to see stability, or even growth, in the medium to long term? For many of the major platforms, like Monster and Indeed, the answer is no.

However, I came across the O`*`NET Interest Profiler web app on the United States Department of Labor’s (DOL) <a href="https://www.mynextmove.org/"> My Next Move website</a>, which attempts to take on these problems. The Interest Profiler uses results from a questionnaire to recommend occupations to users based on their interests. It’s actually one of several web-based tools built on public data on from the DOL’s O`*`NET database. As a digital product based on public data and sponsored by the US government about 20 years ago, the Interest Profiler represents a very early example of federal civic technology.

I’m a huge civic tech nerd, so naturally I explored the tool and researched to find as much information about its creation as I could. I discovered that while the tool is deeply flawed, as any two-decade-old product is bound to be, it is still very successful in many ways. Thinking about how job seekers decide on their careers today, I realized that there might even be an opportunity to redesign the product for a contemporary user.

But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s first see how the Interest Profiler works.

<h3>The Product</h3>

Upon reaching the website, the user is greeted with an introduction to the tool that provides an explanation about what it does and who it’s for. Users are told that they’re about to answer 60 questions that will help them decide which career path is right for them.

Once the user clicks through 4 text-heavy pages, they reach the first of five pages with 12-questions each. Users are prompted to rate different occupational tasks on a scale of 1-5 based on how much they enjoy, or think they would enjoy, doing them. Here’s a sample of some of the activities: “Teach an individual an exercise routine;” “Inventory supplies using a hand-held computer;” and “Assemble electronic parts.” At this point, I'm not entirely sure how the results will reflect my answers to these questions.

After completing all 60 questions, the user is presented with their score (apparently, I’m “enterprising,” “investigative” and “artistic”).

After clicking through more pages, the user is instructed to decide how much education or training they are willing to undertake in their job search. The Interest Profiler then provides the user with career recommendations based on the results from the assessment and the user’s reported desire to pursue additional training.

Users can scroll through the list of several dozen occupations and click on any of them to see detailed information about a job. Jobs that are projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to experience high demand in the coming years are marked with sun-shaped icons. An explanation of their methodology is provided <a href="https://www.mynextmove.org/help/about/">here</a>.

There are, unsurprisingly, a lot of careers available for exploration in the DOL’s data portal; over 900, actually! Even when the user chooses to view a list of all careers, the Interest Profiler application still helpfully arranges the list by highlighting “Best fit” occupations.

Clicking on an occupation, such as “Retail Salesperson”, directs the user out to another web page that displays a detailed description of the job, lists of required skills and day-to-day tasks. From a user’s perspective, learning that retail salespeople should have strong listening skills might be very helpful for someone unsure of what skills to work on developing.

From this new page, the user can also view education and training requirements for the occupation, salary information and similar occupations. Each of the sections that present this information contain links to more pages with maps that break down hiring trends geographically and links to occupational certification programs.  

A user considering a career as a Personal Financial Advisor, which does require special certification, is able to search for training programs nearby where they can earn required certifications within their zip code.

The Interest Profiler is built to be the starting point in a job seeker’s journey. It leverages public data to empower job seekers who know they want to make a change, but don’t know where to start to see all of the career options available to them. Moreover, it’s free, which makes the tool available to anyone who needs it.

Despite the Interest Profiler’s antiquated look, it tries to solve a real pain point for job seekers—not knowing what occupations fit one’s interests—that isn’t addressed by many other job search products. However, I think there are several missed opportunities with the tool to successfully solve user problems and align with DOL organizational goals. I’ll explore these possibilities further in Part 2 (coming soon).
