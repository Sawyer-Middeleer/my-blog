Apologies in advance for anyone now or in the future reading this looking for somewhat-cogent analysis of web3 or municipal policy because this post is going to be more of a journal entry. 

Today marks the start of my first vacation in over a year that didn't involve moving cross-country. During that period, Thrasio blasted off into hypergrowth. We tripled headcount in 12 months to over 1500 people. The portfolio of businesses I managed expanded from 50 SKUs and $10M in annual revenue to 400 SKUs doing over $60M in 8 countries. I took over a team of 7 reports and discovered a passion for mentorship. My day to day work expanded far beyond my job description to include development of internal tech products and execution of corporate strategy initiatives.

At the same time, our breakneck pace and evolving company priorities created a colossal amount of organizational debt. This liability left us ill-equipped to respond nimbly to the supply chain challenges that afflicted our industry all year. We were a cargo ship trying to slolom through glaciers in a storm. My team and I ground through back-to-back-to-back 70-90 hour weeks desperate to hold the business together. Once this leg of the journey is over, I'm definitely going to dive into these topics in more detail.

As all of that was going on, I found myself falling into a quarter life crisis. I never aspired to build a business that sold stuff on the internet (Thrasio was really the only opportunity out there at the start of the pandemic in 2020) but I was suddenly making substantial sacrifices on nights and weekends. I poured what little time and energy I had left outside of work into my close relationships and exploring the web3 rabbithole. Nevertheless, I started to feel increasingly isolated and trapped.

All that's to say burnt out doesn't even begin to describe the bone-piercing exhaustion that took over my body when I closed my laptop at the end of the week and sat at my desk without impending deadlines or deliverables. 

I'm not going to tie this piece up with a bow. I don't think I've had enough time yet to reflect the last twelve months, let alone make proclamations about the next twelve. All I know is now that I have a precious moment to slow down and think, I'm going to take full advantage of it.
