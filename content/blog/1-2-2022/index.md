I really thought 2021 would be the year that I started writing more regularly. I spent hours updating this website that I use as a blog and even made a Substack account. But after sharing a handful of essays in 2020 I wouldn't publish a single piece again until sitting down to write this one. What happened?

Hyper growth at a wartime startup, that's what. Thrasio, the company I work at, hired nearly 1000 new people in 2021, 10x'ing in size from when I started a year and a half ago. My scope of responsibility exploded to include new brand portfolios worth over $60M in annual revenue and a basketball team (plus reserves) that reported to me. Meanwhile, global supply chains continued their years-long meltdown, throwing a container ship sized wrench into our operations. 

But these are subjects for another day. 

2021 was also a year of discovery that led me down the rabbit hole of web3 and reignited my passion for building. Ever since I first read about Ethereum in 2018 I was intrigued by crypto but didn't yet have enough of a background to understand the potential. After learning more about the technology and ecosystem, it's clear to me that web3 is in position to be one of the most consequential technology movements of this generation.

It's also where I want to focus my attention and effort. 

The key innovation of web3 is a set of mechanisms for human coordination at scale. Tokenomics, smart contracts and scarce digital assets enabled by decentralized protocols are powerful tools for aligning incentives and coordinating action around shared goals. 

When I started grad school, my motivation to study public policy was driven by realizing that private companies - Alphabet, Uber, Facebook - were beginning to drive change in the public realm with more speed and dynamism than state and local governments. How were they were able to act with so much leverage while the public sector often couldn't?  What would these companies would be able to achieve if they tried to build for social good, rather than pure profit?

We're already seeing web3 turbocharge this trend. DAOs, NFT clubs and other experimental projects are wielding the power of their communities to experiment with new forms of organizational governance and capital allocation. Projects like Gitcoin and Regen Network have delivered compelling proofs of concept that show it's possible to use smart contracts and tokenomics to overcome thorny coordination traps to funding public goods.

I don't know where this all is going, but I'm going to jump on and join the ride. There is still so much left to build.
