When I first transitioned into the product manager role, I read as much as I could online about how to be successful. Over and over, I read blogs and articles explaining that the product manager is “the CEO of the product.” At first glance, this analogy makes sense. The PM is responsible in many cases for product strategy, go to market and sometimes even distribution. They work with multi-functional teams to identify and execute on new business opportunities. In some cases, a PM may even have responsibility for a P&L. 

But here’s where that analogy comes up short. Although PMs are involved in virtually every decision regarding their product, they differ in a fundamental way from true CEOs. Julia Austin, Senior Lecturer in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at the Harvard Business School, <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/12/what-it-takes-to-become-a-great-product-manager">explains</a>: “Product managers simply don’t have any direct authority over most of the things needed to make their products successful.” 

I’d like to propose a new analogy that I think is a better fit. <b>In reality, a product manager is the mayor of their product.</b> Unlike a CEO who is the last word on everything to do with their company, a mayor leads through consensus, negotiation and diplomacy. Regarding nearly every issue from property taxation to trash collection, the mayor wields only soft power and must painstakingly build coalitions to convince city councilmembers, voters and state lawmakers to support their goals.

The same is true for product managers. The best PMs are masters at relationship management and have a knack for building connections within their companies. Without direct authority, PMs must earn buy-in from their engineering team, customers and management in order to create alignment around priorities. Balancing competing interests while also delivering high quality products and features – ones that aren’t compromised by trying to be everything to everyone – requires both a high amount of emotional intelligence and empathy, as well as an ability to make persuasive evidence-based arguments. Great PMs and politicians understand that the best decisions make everyone feel like they’re winning.
